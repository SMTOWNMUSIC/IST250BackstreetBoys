<p><strong>"Anywhere For You"</strong></p>

<p>I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to</p>

<p>I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way believe me
Even through the darkest night you know</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you</p>

<p>I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [3x]</p>

<p>[Chorus 2x]</p>
