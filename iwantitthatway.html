<p><strong>"I Want It That Way"</p></strong>

<p>Yeah</p>

<p>[Brian:]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way</p>

<p>[Nick:]
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way</p>

<p>[AJ:]
Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way</p>

<p>[Kevin:]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...</p>

<p>[Howie:]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are
You are, you are, you are</p>

<p>Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way</p>

<p>Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way</p>

<p>Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (never wanna hear you say)
I want it that way</p>

<p>'Cause I want it that way'</p>
